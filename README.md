# bamazon


"Bamazon" is an Amazon-like storefront. The bamazonCustomer application displays all the product information and allows the user to place orders depletes stock from the store's inventory.

The app prompts users with two messages.

   * The first asks them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
   * The second message asks how many units of the product they would like to buy.

Once the customer has placed the order, the application checks if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

   * If not, the app logs the phrase "Sorry, there is insufficient stock to complete your order." , and then prevents the order from going through.

However, if the store doeshave enough of the product, the customer's order is fulflled.
   * Once the order goes through, the application displays the total cost of the purchase.
